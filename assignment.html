                    BMW's history can be traced back to 1916, when the Flugmaschinenfabrik Gustav Otto merged with
                    Bayerische Flugzeug-Werke AG (BFW). In 1917, the Rapp Motorenwerke company became Bayerische Motoren
                    Werke GmbH, which was later converted into a public limited company in 1918. In 1922, BMW AG
                    transferred
                    its engine construction operations to BFW, and the date of BFW's founding is now considered the
                    foundation date of BMW.
